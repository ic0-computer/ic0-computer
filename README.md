# ic0.computer

Still a work in progress, but ic0.computer allows for a user to connect a primary account using an internet identity and connect any other subsidiary accounts using IC wallets. All principals are unique and cannot be repeated across different accounts. The idea is that a user can create a portfolio showcase of which NFTs and fungible tokens they own and share their portfolio with others. Future features include an NFT exchange and portfolio tracking tools as well as custom showcasing. The user also has the option to mine principals of a certain substring and if a match is found, get the seed phrase of that principal, just a little fun feature I thought to add.

### connectr library

connectr is a simple TypeScript library that makes it easy to connect to popular wallet apps such as Stoic, Plug, and Bitfinity as well as load multiple identities from seed phrase. I initially developed this library because of all the trouble I had with the outdated Connect2IC library.

### ic0-tools

ic0 tools just has a few functions at the moment which are -- creating custom avatars from principals or account ids, converting principals to account ids, and generating principals randomly or from seed phrases.

### computr extension

Also unfinished, the idea with the computr extension is that it can serve as an alternate and safer way of handling your identity instead of loading a seed phrase directly into a wallet. It is a wallet interface that does not store the seed phrase of the wallet itself, but will display the commands to execute on the dfx command line. This way, the wallet interface could even be used in conjunction with an identity that is stored on an air-gapped computer.
